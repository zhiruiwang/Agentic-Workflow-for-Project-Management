# Phase 1: Building Your Agent Library

## 1. Introduction

In the first phase of the project, you will build a library of reusable agents designed to support agentic workflows. While these agents will be used in the Phase 2 Project Management workflow, they are intended for general use across a variety of workflows.

In this phase, you will develop both the agent library and supporting scripts that instantiate and test each agent. These scripts will help verify that the agents function correctly and give you a deeper understanding of their behavior and capabilities.

**By the end of this phase, you will have:**

* Implemented seven agent classes in a single `base_agents.py` file, each demonstrating a unique agent workflow.
* Verified each agent’s behavior with a standalone test script.
* Organized your code into a clean, importable package that can be extended in Phase 2.

## 2. Directory Structure

You will see files inside the `phase_1` folder arranged as follows:

```
phase_1/
├── workflow_agents/
│   ├── __init__.py             ← (empty)
│   └── base_agents.py          ← Student implementation file
├── direct_prompt_agent.py
├── augmented_prompt_agent.py
├── knowledge_augmented_prompt_agent.py
├── rag_knowledge_prompt_agent.py
├── evaluation_agent.py
├── routing_agent.py
└── action_planning_agent.py
```

* `workflow_agents` is a Python package containing all your agent class definitions.
* One script per agent to test their functionality has also been provided in the folder.

**Environment Configuration:** Create a `.env` file in the `phase_1` folder (or copy from project root) containing your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## 3. Agent Library Implementation

Complete each agent class in `workflow_agents/base_agents.py` in the following order, and validate using the provided test scripts.

### 3.1 Direct Prompt Agent

A **Direct Prompt Agent** offers the most straightforward method for interacting with a Large Language Model (LLM). It directly relays a user's input (prompt) to the LLM and returns the LLM's response without incorporating additional context, memory, or specialized tools.

---

#### Define the `DirectPromptAgent` Class

**File:** `workflow_agents/base_agents.py`

Complete the following tasks to implement your `DirectPromptAgent` class:

1.  **Import the `OpenAI` Class:** Import the `OpenAI` class from the OpenAI Python library.
2.  **Store the API Key:** Within the class constructor (`__init__`), create an attribute named `openai_api_key` to store the provided OpenAI API key.
3.  **Select the LLM Model:** When calling the OpenAI API, select the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model for generating completions.
4.  **Send the User Prompt:** Pass the user-provided prompt directly to the model as a user message. Do not include a system prompt.
5.  **Implement the `respond` method:** Return only the content (text) of the LLM's response, not the full JSON payload.

---

#### Test the `DirectPromptAgent` Class

**File:** `direct_prompt_agent_test.py`

Complete these steps in your test script to verify the functionality of the `DirectPromptAgent`:

1.  **Import the Class:** Import the `DirectPromptAgent` class from `base_agents.py`.
2.  **Load the API Key:** Use the `dotenv` library to securely load your OpenAI API key from an environment file.
3.  **Instantiate the Agent:** Create an instance of the `DirectPromptAgent` class named `direct_agent` using the loaded API key.
4.  **Prompt the Agent:** Send the following prompt to the agent, store the response, and print it:
    ```
    "What is the Capital of France?"
    ```
5.  **Explain Knowledge Source:** Include a descriptive print statement explaining source of the knowledge the agent used to respond to your prompt (Hint: the agent uses general knowledge from the selected LLM model).

---

### 3.2 Augmented Prompt Agent

An **Augmented Prompt Agent** is a specialized agent designed to respond according to a predefined persona. Unlike basic prompt-response interactions, this agent explicitly adopts a persona, leading to more targeted and contextually relevant outputs.

---

#### Define the `AugmentedPromptAgent` Class

**File:** `workflow_agents/base_agents.py`

Complete the following steps to implement your `AugmentedPromptAgent` class:

1.  **Create Persona Attribute:** Create an attribute within the class to store the agent's persona.
2.  **Call OpenAI API:** Declare a variable (e.g., `response`) to store the result of calling OpenAI's API for chat completions.
3.  **Include System Prompt:** Construct a system prompt that instructs the agent to assume the defined persona. Ensure the agent is explicitly told to forget any previous conversational context.
4.  **Return Textual Content:** In the `respond` method, return only the textual content of the response from the API, not the full JSON response.

---

#### Test the `AugmentedPromptAgent` Class

**File:** `augmented_prompt_agent_test.py`

Complete the following tasks in your test script to test the `AugmentedPromptAgent`:

1.  **Import the Class:** Import the `AugmentedPromptAgent` class from `base_agents.py`.
2.  **Instantiate the Agent:** Create an instance of the `AugmentedPromptAgent` class using your OpenAI API key and a defined persona.
3.  **Send a Prompt:** Send a prompt to the agent and store the result in a variable named `augmented_agent_response`.
4.  **Print the Response:** Clearly print the `augmented_agent_response` to verify the agent’s behavior.
5.  **Provide Explanatory Comments:** Include comments discussing:
    * The type of knowledge the agent likely used to generate its response.
    * How specifying the agent’s persona affected the final output.

---

### 3.3 Knowledge Augmented Prompt Agent

The **Knowledge Augmented Prompt Agent** is designed to incorporate specific, provided knowledge alongside a defined persona when responding to prompts, ensuring answers are based on that explicit information.

---

#### Define the `KnowledgeAugmentedPromptAgent` Class

**File:** `workflow_agents/base_agents.py`

Complete the following steps to build this agent class:

1.  **Create Persona Attribute:** Create an attribute for storing the agent’s persona.
2.  **Create Knowledge Attribute:** Create an attribute for storing the agent’s specific knowledge.
3.  **Implement the `respond` method:** Within this method:
    * Construct a **system message** that clearly defines the persona with the instruction:
        ```
        You are _persona_ knowledge-based assistant. Forget all previous context.
        ```
        (Replace `_persona_` with the actual persona variable/attribute).
    * Clearly specify the provided knowledge in the system message:
        ```
        Use only the following knowledge to answer, do not use your own knowledge: _knowledge_
        ```
        (Replace `_knowledge_` with the actual knowledge variable/attribute).
    * Include a final instruction in the system message:
        ```
        Answer the prompt based on this knowledge, not your own.
        ```
4.  **Append User Prompt:** Append the user's input prompt as a separate message in the API request.

        ```
    * **Knowledge:**
        ```
        "The capital of France is London, not Paris"
        ```
4.  **Test the Agent:** Use the following prompt:
    ```
    "What is the capital of France?"
    ```
5.  **Confirm Knowledge Usage:** Add a print statement to confirm the agent’s response explicitly uses the provided knowledge rather than its inherent knowledge from the LLM.
